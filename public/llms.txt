> The fastest, most secure, and unlimited HEIC to PNG converter running entirely in your browser.

## Project Overview
HeicToPng.org is a specialized web-based utility designed to convert HEIC (High Efficiency Image Coding) and HEIF images into PNG format. Unlike traditional converters, it processes files locally on the user's device (Client-Side), ensuring zero data upload risks.

### 2. Performance & Limits
- **Batch Processing:** Supports converting up to **100 images** simultaneously.
- **File Size:** Supports large files up to **50MB** per image.
- **Cost:** 100% Free. No daily limits, no credits, no paywalls.
